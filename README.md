# Embeddable React OpenAI Chatbot

A modern, embeddable chatbot built with React, Next.js, AI SDK, and Tailwind CSS. This chatbot can be embedded on any website as a single script file.

## Features

-   🤖 Powered by OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo via AI SDK
-   🎨 Beautiful UI built with Tailwind CSS
-   📦 Embeddable as a single script file
-   🔄 Real-time streaming responses
-   📝 Markdown rendering support (code blocks, lists, tables, etc.)
-   📚 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with PDF knowledge base
-   ⚡ Built with Next.js for the API route
-   🎯 TypeScript support

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with your OpenAI API key and Assistant ID:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ASSISTANT_ID=asst_your_assistant_id_here
```

3. **Set up RAG with PDF (Optional but recommended):**

    Place your PDF file in the project root (e.g., `kisco-big-2025-compressed.pdf`) and run:

    ```bash
    npm run setup:assistant
    ```

    This will:

    - Upload the PDF to OpenAI's file storage
    - Create a vector store with the PDF content
    - Create an Assistant with knowledge retrieval enabled
    - Save the configuration to `assistant-config.json` (for reference)

    **Important:** After running the setup, copy the `assistantId` from `assistant-config.json` and add it to your `.env.local` file as `ASSISTANT_ID=asst_...`

    The chatbot will use the assistant specified in `ASSISTANT_ID` for RAG-enabled conversations.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the chatbot in action.

## Building

### Build Next.js App

```bash
npm run build
```

### Build Embeddable Script

```bash
npm run build:embed
```

This creates a single embeddable script at `dist/embed/chatbot.iife.js` that can be included on any website.

## Embedding on Another Site

### Option 1: Simple Embed (Auto-initialize)

The script automatically loads the required CSS file from the same directory. Just include the script tag:

```html
<script
    src="https://your-domain.com/chatbot.iife.js"
    data-api-url="https://your-api-domain.com/api/chat"
    data-title="Chat Assistant"
    data-placeholder="Type your message..."
></script>
```

**Note:** Make sure both `chatbot.iife.js` and `style.css` are served from the same directory. The script will automatically inject the CSS when it loads.

### Option 2: Manual Initialization

```html
<!-- CSS is automatically loaded, but you can also include it manually -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-domain.com/style.css" />
<script src="https://your-domain.com/chatbot.iife.js"></script>
<script>
    window.initChatbot({
        apiUrl: 'https://your-api-domain.com/api/chat',
        title: 'Chat Assistant',
        placeholder: 'Type your message...',
        systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
        containerId: 'chatbot-root', // optional, defaults to 'chatbot-root'
    });
</script>
```

## API Route

The chatbot expects a POST endpoint at `/api/chat` that accepts:

```json
{
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }]
}
```

And returns a streaming response compatible with the AI SDK format.

For Azure serverless deployment, you can adapt the API route in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to work with Azure Functions.

```

## Customization

The chatbot component accepts the following props:

-   `apiUrl`: API endpoint URL (default: "/api/chat")
-   `title`: Chat window title (default: "Chat Assistant")
-   `placeholder`: Input placeholder text (default: "Type your message...")
-   `systemPrompt`: System prompt for the AI (optional)

Cost Factor 100MB Corpus ~1000 Pages Corpus Change
Initial Embedding Cost $25 - $35 $10 - $20 Negligible savings
Vector DB Hosting (Monthly) $50 - $150 $20 - $100 Minor reduction

Reduce query cost can use nano/fast models or do an api call with the text embedding and summarize it, then use the smaller summary embedding to minimze the token count

## TODO

-   store chat in session storage to persist hard refreshs, new page loads
-   move api route to azure
    -   add auth
-   updating RAG from sharepoint, and keeping those files small
